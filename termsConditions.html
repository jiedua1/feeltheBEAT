  <h1>
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  </h1>
  <code>
    <p> We thought of writing a comprehensive terms and conditions that would grant us exclusive use of your 
      personal data, since we know that you 99% won't read this
      especially if you're a human being.  
      
      <br><br>  However, every single member of our team was/is 
      a hardcore CS major in college and as a result, 
      NO ONE on this team can write more than three coherent sentences in a row, 
      let alone an entire terms and conditions. 
      
      <br> <br> 
      
      You might be wondering, 
      "hey, this terms and conditions so far seems relatively coherent 
      and seems to be longer than three sentences." Well, that's because this isn't written
      by us; this is written by reddit user 
      <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/user/englishmajor4hire"> u/englishmajor4hire </a>

      This rest of this document might seem odd to you since usually these legal shenannigans are written by human beans 
      called liars who have fancy degrees from prestigious lie schools (where they study Lie algebras in depth). 
      Originally, we were going to hire a country liar off of Fiverr to write the rest of the document for us, but we 
      found none on Fiverr or related websites (we did not realize the going price for a liar was much more than for an English major).
      Therefore, the next line encapsulates the most important part of this statement:

      We can't write, but we love machine learning, especially open source machine learning. There are 
      so many <b> useful </b>
      applications of ML being deployed and coming up... maybe we'll finally have a way to make money.
      To show support to OpenAI for advancing AI research and to cover our own asses in case one of you 
      are rich enough to hire liars and attack our honorable business, we'll continue
      this terms and conditions, with all the rest of the text generated by the GPT-2 language model
